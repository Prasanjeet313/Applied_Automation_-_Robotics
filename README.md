# Digital Twin of a Ball Mill simulated in python pybullet and SPHysics dynamic simulation
# a list of code snippets and explanations for building a digital twin of a ball mill simulation using Discrete Element Method (DEM) and Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) concepts. This setup focuses on using Python for general code structure, DualSPHysics for DEM-SPH simulations, and PyBullet for managing the physics environment.

# This code is split into sections to achieve specific functionalities in the ball mill digital twin.
